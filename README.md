# AS-LLM

AS-LLM (Algorithm Selection model based on Large Language Models) is a novel approach to automated algorithm selection. It leverages the powerful representation capability of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract algorithm features from code-related text. LLMs capture not only the syntax structure of code but also semantic information and contextual awareness, making them suitable for representing algorithms across diverse programming languages. They also leverage extensive knowledge from large-scale code repositories, enabling them to represent common patterns, library function usage, and module relationships. This imparts superior domain adaptation capabilities to LLMs in algorithm selection tasks.

## Usage
Before using the code, it is important to install the necessary libraries commonly used in the field of machine learning, such as numpy, sklearn, torch, scipy, pandas, and others. Additionally, please make sure to install the aslib_scenario library, which provides the testing scenarios related to AS-LLM.
